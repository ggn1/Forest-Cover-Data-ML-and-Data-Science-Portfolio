# Forest Cover Data ML and Data Science Portfolio

This project employs different data processing, analysis and visualization methods on forest cover data and draws insights/conclusions from it. Multiple machine learning algorithms were also experimented with.

The project file is named, "ML_DataScience_Portfolio.ipynb".

### Note!

The dataset used for this project was obtained form **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype . The files covtype.data and covtype.info, that is present in the Dataset_CoverType folder was obtained from here. So, should the reader wish to try and work with the same data, kindly use the above link to obtain it.

Details of the source of used data as mentioned on UCI Machine Learning Repository is as follows.
