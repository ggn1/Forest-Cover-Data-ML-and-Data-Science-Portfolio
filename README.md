# Forest Cover Data ML and Data Science Portfolio

This project serves to provide a glimpse at the kinds of data processing, analysis and visualization that is possible with data, and how insights/conclusions may be drawn from it. 

This project employs both traditional methods of data science as well as Machine Learning techniques.

The project file is named, "ML_DataScience_Portfolio.ipynb".

### Note!

The dataset used for this project was obtained form **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype . The files covtype.data and covtype.info, that is present in the Dataset_CoverType folder was obtained from here. So, should the reader wish to try and work with the same data, kindly use the above link to obtain it.
